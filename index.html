        <h3>Hampi</h3>
        <p>
          Hampi, located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in Karnataka, is a captivating UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its ancient ruins and breathtaking landscape. Once the majestic capital of the Vijayanagara Empire between the 14th and 16th centuries, it spans over 40 square kilometres and houses nearly 1,600 monuments. The town’s name originates from ‘Pampa’, the ancient name of the river and an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, giving the place a divine significance rooted in Hindu mythology. Among its most famous landmarks is the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, where worship has continued unbroken since the 7th century. The Vittala Temple, adorned with its intricately carved stone chariot and musical pillars, stands as a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture. Visitors can also explore the Hampi Bazaar, Queen’s Bath, Lotus Mahal, and the massive royal enclosures that tell tales of regal grandeur. The surreal terrain of giant boulders, green paddy fields, and crumbling ruins adds a mystical charm to every sight. Sunrise from Matanga Hill or sunset at Hemakuta Hill offers unparalleled views of the golden ruins beneath a crimson sky. Mythologically, Hampi is associated with the Kishkinda Kingdom from the Ramayana, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. Accessible by road and nearest to Hospet, it attracts historians, photographers, and backpackers alike. The best time to visit is from October to February when the climate is pleasant. Today, Hampi stands as a magnificent reminder of India’s glorious past, where history, legend, and spirituality seamlessly converge.

The palace, once home to the Wadiyar Dynasty who ruled Mysore for over five centuries, remains a symbol of royal heritage and cultural grandeur.
